# Assignment3

## this is the 209AS 2023 fall HCI assignment3 code 

**run with Unity 2021.3.2f1**
**original code template from https://github.com/sypei/unity-dev-workshop-and-hw4**

- Like in GUI, users use touch or mouse clicks to engage and release an object, we use hand gesture **grab** to engage and release the
object.
- Objects and targets are of the same size.
- Objects and targets are positioned at the same height (1D Fitt sâ€™ Law test).
- Test objects and targets of three different widths **which starts from 0.1 and will be added up to 0.12 and 0.14**.
- Test three different distances between objects and targets **which starts from 0.4 and will be decline to 0.3 and 0.2**.
- Accept the trial if objects overlap with targets for more than 80% **in which case the target object will turn green**, or discard the data and restart the trial.
- Have 10 trials per width-distance combination per participant. **90 trials in total per participant**
